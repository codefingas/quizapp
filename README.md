# quizapp
The challenge is to create a small API for a quiz app where users can create and attempt quizzes. The users should also be able to see some basic stats about their quiz attempts.


Limitations:
1. Soft Delete was not implemented.
2. Pagination was not fully implemented.
3. jsonwebtoken is outdated and was last published 3 years ago.
4. JWT logout is not the best implementation and might be open to hackers.
4. All POST request can only handle 1 record at a time for now.
5. Error message is not optimal and can be way better than what is currrently implemented.
